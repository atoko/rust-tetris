# rust-tetris
## Description
A small attempt at building with Rust.
This is a tetris clone that leverages the rltk (https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib) toolkit, which provides rendering and game loop facilities.
It is compiled to WASM and uses an OpenGL backend to render to Canvas. It is available to play at https://atoko.github.io/rust-tetris/

It is certainly not idiomatic Rust code. although the entire game loop fits in under 300 lines.
