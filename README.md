# rust-tetris
## Description
A tetris clone built with the rltk (https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib) library, which provides cross-platform rendering and game loop facilities. This is a learning exercise to get familiar with the Rust toolchain, so note that this code is not "production-ready".

The Rust code is compiled to WASM via `wasm-bindgen`, using an OpenGL backend to render to Canvas. It is available to play at https://atoko.github.io/rust-tetris/
